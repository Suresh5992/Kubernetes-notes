 Kubernetes Architecture:

1. Data Plane (Worker Node)
Kubelet: Creates and manages Pods.
Kube-Proxy: Handles networking, often using iptables in Linux environments.
Container Runtime: Provides the environment for running containers (e.g., Docker, container).
2. Control Plane (Master Node)
API Server: Exposes Kubernetes API to external users and components.
Scheduler: Assigns Pods to nodes based on resource requirements and cluster policies, receiving inputs from the API server.
etcd: A distributed key-value store for backing up the cluster's configuration and state.
Controller Manager: Manages various controllers, such as Replica Sets, to maintain the desired state of the cluster. Cloud Controller Manager (CCM): Handles integration with cloud-specific services, like load balancers and storage.
